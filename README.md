#### FAQ

### What About Testing?

Testing has been left out of this package to be testing agnostic. 

Please feel free to use your preferred testing library if desired, but don't PR to include a testing library with this scaffolding.

### Whoa, what about Reporting Web Vitals?

I personally do not use reportWebVitals.js very frequently and just drop it back in if I need it.

Please do the same if you require it for your own projects.
